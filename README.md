# A short story about me

Since I was young computers were always on my side, I started my own business providing tech-support to small and medium-sized companies, after that, I discover that client facing teams were my passion. During this time I have developed myself as a computer analyst, polishing my knowledge in various technical areas such as server maintenance, cloud services, and software development (HTML5, SQL, Python).

# Current goals
 Currently I'm making some big changes in my career, I started a job as a QA and moving forward into the development world. To enforce this I'm pursuing a Bachelors degree at UOC for Techniques for Software Application Development.
